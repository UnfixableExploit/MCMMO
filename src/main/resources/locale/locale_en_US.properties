So you don't have to worry\n&eabout destroying items without getting anything in return.
Guides.Salvage.Section.3=&1To illustrate how this works, here's an example:\n&eLet's say we salvage a gold pickaxe which is damaged for 20%,\n&ethis means that the maximum amount you could get is only 2\n&e(because the pick is crafted with 3 ingots - each worth\n&e33,33% durability) which is equal to 66%. If your yield\n&epercentage is below 66% you are not able to get 2 ingots.\n&eIf it is above this value you are able to gain the "full amount",\n&ewhich means that you will get 2 ingots.
Guides.Salvage.Section.4=&1How does Arcane Salvage work?\n&eThis ability allows you to get enchanted books when salvaging\n&eenchanted items. Depending on your level the chance of\n&esuccessfully extracting a full or partial enchantment varies.\n\n&eWhen an enchantment is partially extracted, the enchantment\n&ebook will have a lower level enchantment compared to what\n&eit was on the item.
